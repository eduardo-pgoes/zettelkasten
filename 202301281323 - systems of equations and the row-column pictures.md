imagine the following system of equations:
$$
\begin{align*}
  & 2u + v + w & =3 \\
  & 4u - 6v  &=-2 \\
  & -2u + 7v + 2w & =9
\end{align*}
$$
each equation describes a plane in $R^3$ and the system solution describes a point where all of them intersect. in fact, there's one such point on each plane (...if the system has solutions).
that's the row picture.

the column picture would state this same system of equations as a linear cominbations of columns (...or vectors):

$$
u \left( \matrix{ 2 \cr 4 \cr -2} \right) + v \left( \matrix{ 1 \cr -6 \cr 7} \right) + w \left( \matrix{ 0 \cr 7 \cr 2} \right) = \left( \matrix{ 3 \cr -2 \cr 9} \right)
$$
... which such combination of vectors result in the following vector? each such vector is a system solution.
